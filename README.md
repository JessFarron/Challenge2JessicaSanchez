# Challenge2JessicaSanchez

This project was developed as a simulation of the presentation of a developer in a web page. In my case I only substituted the name to give it a more personal touch, the rest was designed according to the mock that the "client assigned". The page is compatible with different devices (sizes) , so it keeps good looking when changing from one to another. 

It has different important sections:
-The introductory presentation, where only the name and the navigation bar of the three sections of the page appear. Ech word in the nav bar will led to the respective section and decorative cover.

-Section "About me", where the developer explains more about himself and experience.

- Section "Works" with the links that would lead directly to the respective developed applications, in this case repositories.
